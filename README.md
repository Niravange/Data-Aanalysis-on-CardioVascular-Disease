# Data-Analysis-on-CardioVascular-Disease
Cardiovascular diseases are the major cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year. 
Currently, India has more than 30 million heart patients. By 2030, almost 23.6 million people will die from 
CVDs, mainly from heart disease and stroke. These are projected to remain the single leading causes of death.
Cardiovascular diseases are a group of disorders that disturbs the normal functioning of the heart.
Cardiovascular disease refers to conditions that involve narrowed or blocked blood vessels that can lead to a 
heart attack, chest pain (angina) or stroke. Cardiovascular diseases are a group of disorders of the heart and 
blood vessels and include coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, rheumatic heart disease and other 
conditions. Prediction of cardiovascular disease is regarded as one of the most important subjects in the section 
of clinical data analysis.
The analysis has been performed considering two factors i.e psychological factors and behavioural factors.It 
is evident that psychological factors changes drastically due to behavioural factors. This project helps to 
understand the effect of behavioural factors on psychological factors. The main goal which we try to achieve 
in this exploratory data analysis is to get more clarified sight for which kind of attributes may be a more 
significant signal of incoming heart disease
